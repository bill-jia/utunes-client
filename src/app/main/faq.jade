		h2.md-primary Where does the name "Twig Tape" come from?
		p UTS's motto is "Velut arbor ita ramus", which translates from Latin to "As the tree, so the branch". This represents UTS's affiliation with the University of Toronto, the tree being the University of Toronto, and the branch being UTS. Because of this motto UTS's annual yearbook is named the Twig as it is an offshoot of UTS (the branch) and for this same reason the annual CD production is called the Twig Tape.
